# FORAGE British Airways Data Science project
Scrape and analyse customer review data to uncover findings for British Airways

Task 1: Web Scraping and Analysis.
We scrape customer reviews for British Airways from skytrax and analyse the data collected for usable insights.

Instructions:
This Jupyter notebook includes some code to get you started with web scraping. We will use a package called BeautifulSoup to collect the data from the web. Once you've collected your data and saved it into a local .csv file you should start with your analysis.

Scraping data from Skytrax If you visit [https://www.airlinequality.com] you can see that there is a lot of data there. For this task, we are only interested in reviews related to British Airways and the Airline itself.

If you navigate to this link: [https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways] you will see this data. Now, we can use Python and BeautifulSoup to collect all the links to the reviews and then to collect the text data on each of the individual review links.
